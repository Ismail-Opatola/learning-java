		 * + don't require you to click a component to give it focus
		 * + all Swing components use Key Bindings
		 * + increased flexibility compared to KeyListeners
		 * + can assign key strokes to individual Swing components e.g Player1 having a set of keyB, Player2 having a set of KeyB on the same keyboard
		 * + more difficult to utilize and set up
